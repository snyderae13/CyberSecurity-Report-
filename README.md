# CyberSecurity-Report-


In 2022, Vodafone was victim to a source code theft after a cybercrime group claimed to have stolen hundreds of gigabytes of source code from the company. The name of the cybercrime group, "Lapsus$", are claiming that they have stolen up to 200GB , or approximately 5,000 GitHub repositories. However, after Vodafone had made a brief investigation they came to the conclusion that : " generally the types of repositories referenced in the claim contain proprietary source code and do not contain customer data". As of now , the hackers have not leaked any of the Vodafone source code. They have however asked thousands of their subscribers on Telegram in a poll if they should leak the proprietary code or not.
